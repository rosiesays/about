Website for Rosie, an application that detects under-confident language in emails.

# About

Rosie is a Chrome extension that detects undermining language and suggests more confident phrasing to help people represent themselves as the professionals they are. 

This extension is named for Rosie the Riveter, who is a symbol for female empowerment in the workplace. Teaching yourself to write confidently will help you develop a good relationship with your colleagues, negotiate salary offers, and establish your credibility as a professional.

Forbes  asserts that using words like “just” or “maybe”, apologizing when unneeded, or using phrases like “I’m no expert” or “I don’t know” all demean confidence in the workplace. We polled over 100 people for words they have identified during business conversations that make themselves sound less confident. From this, we gathered 45 words and phrases that Rosie can identify and offer suggestions for change.

Rosie can be used with Gmail, Google Inbox, Outlook, Yahoo, LinkedIn, and Slack.

You can install Rosie on the [Google Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rosie/hdlcmlhedjiljdeaijfbpdigffccgcbc)!
