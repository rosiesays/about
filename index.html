        <h2> Be Confident.</h2>
        <p>
            Rosie the Riveter is a cultural icon who represents the women who worked in factories and shipyards during World War II. Rosie is used as a symbol of American feminism and economic freedom.
            Several decades later, women still struggle for equal representation in the workplace. A report from McKinsey and Company in 2017 asserted that only 1 in 5 C-Suite leaders are women, and
            entry level women are <b>18%</b> less likely to be promoted than their male counterparts. <br/> <br/>
            Studies show that women may be denying themselves opportunities to be viewed as credible in the workplace by using unconfident or hedging language. Forbes  asserts that using words like “just” or “maybe”, apologizing when unneeded, or using phrases like “I’m no expert” or “I don’t know” all demean confidence.
            This happens because girls are taught to take responsibility for how their behaviors affect others. Girls who are more assertive are typically viewed as abrasive or bossy by their peers. To overcompensate, girls learn to alter their language to include unnecessary apologetic or hedging qualifiers.
            A pattern of hedging language in the workplace causes women to take less credit for their achievements, or damages their credibility when they have ideas or opinions on projects.
